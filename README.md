This a module for the Netflix framework [Karyon](https://github.com/Netflix/karyon) which adds an endpoint /healthcheck [GET] that uses HealthCheckHandler service.
It works close to karyon-rest-router

```
@KaryonBootstrap(name = "AppServer", healthcheck = AlwaysHealthyHealthCheck.class)
@Modules(include = {
    ...
    HealthCheckEndPointModule.class
})
public interface AppServerForTesting {
    ...
}
